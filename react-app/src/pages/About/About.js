        <p>Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!

        <h2>No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.</h2>
        <p>I'm a monster. I'm afraid I just blue myself. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.</p>

        <p>Whoa, this guy's straight? I'm afraid I just blue myself. Army had half a day. I've opened a door here that I regret. We just call it a sausage. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.</p>
        <p>First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. I hear the jury's still out on science. Really? Did nothing cancel? I'm half machine. I'm a monster. I've opened a door here that I regret.</p>
        <p>No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. Guy's a pro. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.</p>
        <p>Across from where? Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.'</p>
        <p>We just call it a sausage. I'm afraid I just blue myself. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Guy's a pro. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast.</p>

        <p>It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Well, what do you expect, mother?</p>

        <p>First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.</p>
